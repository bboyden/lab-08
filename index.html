</h2>
<p>
  This lab was actually very fun and kinda tricky. I built a Node.js + Express server that fetched fake photo data from JSONPlaceholder. I learned how to use <code>fetch()</code> with promises and .then chaining, and got back the first 20 photo objects. Then, I even used AI to help me make a little frontend to show the photo titles! Itâ€™s not real photos but it was very real coding. ðŸš€
